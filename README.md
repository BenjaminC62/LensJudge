### How to Launch the Main Program

To launch the main program, use the following command:

```bash
./gradlew shadowJar
```

Then execute the following command:

```bash
java -jar app/build/libs/lensjudge-shadow-1.0-all.jar ProgTestSae\nameOfTheFile.extension ProgTestSae\file.in ProgTestSae\file.ans -v (1-5)
```
-  -v 1 = Strict verification
-  -v 2 = Order verification
-  -v 3 = Case verification
-  -v 4 = Real numbers verification
-  -v 5 = One of several solutions verification

### Library used
    - AnsiConsole
    - Apache Commons CLI

We used AnsiConsole to color the output of the program.
We used the Apache Commons CLI library to handle command-line arguments.

### IA used
    - Copilot
    - Chatgpt

We used Copilot primarily for error correction and code generation.
We used ChatGPT to gain a deeper understanding of how different design patterns work and to gather insights about our code.

## Commit examples

### For closing an issue
    - git commit -m "Fixes #? - Description of the commit"

### For a bug fix or program changes commit
    - git commit -m "Description of the commit"

### For mentioning an issue 
    - git commit -m "#? - Description of the commit"
